# Python Deliberate Practice

## Motivation

## Deliberate Practice
I truely believe in learning by doing, there is few rules list as following:

**1. Set up the goal and know where you're going.**

**2. Set up the practice plan - the operating procedure.**

**3. Integrate the skill.**

**4. Incorporate feedback - staying on target.**

## Performance Goals
* **[Immediate]** Learn to write pythonic code
* **[Shorter term, easiest to practice]** Write re-usable, modular, tested code for my data work and knowledge posts
* **[Medium term, harder to practice]** Achieve efficiency and feature parity on Data Analysis using Python
* **[Longer term, hardest to practice]** Write tools. Being able to work on projects that span the entire data stack using Python, apply good software engineering principles to these projects
